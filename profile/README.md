### DeepDive is a method for estimating biodiversity from fossil data using simulation-trained deep learning models.

The repositories here contain:

* The [**DeepDive** Python programme](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/deepdive) along with installation instructions.

* The [**DeepDiveR** R package](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/DeepDiveR) that provides an interface to setup DeepDive analyses from fossil occurrence data.

* For [**a worked examples**](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/example_files) using DeepDiveR see [carnivoran_analysis](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/example_files/tree/main/carnivoran_analysis). For Python scripts compatible with older versions of DeepDive  see [marine_analysis](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/example_files/tree/main/marine_analysis) and [proboscidean_analysis](https://github.com/DeepDive-project/example_files/tree/main/proboscidean_analysis).
